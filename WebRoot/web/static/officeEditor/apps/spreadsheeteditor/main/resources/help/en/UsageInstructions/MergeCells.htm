			<h1>Merge cells</h1>
			<p>You can merge two or more adjacent cells into one cell. To do that,</p>
			<ol>
			<li>select two cells or a range of cells with the mouse,
			<p class="note"><b>Note</b>: the selected cells <b>MUST</b> be adjacent.</p>
			</li>
			<li>click the <b>Merge</b> <img alt="Merge icon" src="../images/merge.png" /> icon situated at the <b>Home</b> tab of the top toolbar and select one of the available options:
			<p class="note"><b>Note</b>: only the data in the upper-left cell of the selected range will remain in the merged cell. Data in other cells of the selected range will be deleted.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>if you select the <b>Merge &amp; Center</b> option the cells of the selected range will be merged and the data in the merged cell will be centered;</li>
			<li>if you select the <b>Merge Across</b> option the cells of each row of the selected range will be merged and the data in the merged cells will be aligned by the left side (for text) or by the right side (for numeric values);</li>
			<li>if you select the <b>Merge Cells</b> option the cells of the selected range will be merged and the data will be aligned by the left side (for text) or by the right side (for numeric values).</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ol>
			<p>To split the previously merged cell use the <b>Unmerge Cells</b> option from the <b>Merge</b> drop-down list. The data of the merged cell will be displayed in the upper-left cell.</p>
