        "body": "Spreadsheet Editor lets you change its general advanced settings. To access them, open the File tab at the top toolbar and select the Advanced Settings... option. You can also click the View settings icon on the right side of the editor header and select the Advanced settings option. The general advanced settings are: Commenting Display is used to turn on/off the live commenting option: Turn on display of the comments - if you disable this feature, the commented cells will be marked on the sheet only if you click the Comments icon at the left sidebar. Turn on display of the resolved comments - this feature is disabled by default so that the resolved comments were hidden on the sheet. You can view such comments only if you click the Comments icon at the left sidebar. Enable this option if you want to display resolved comments on the sheet. Autosave is used in the online version to turn on/off automatic saving of changes you make while editing. Autorecover - is used in the desktop version to turn on/off the option that allows to automatically recover spreadsheets in case of the unexpected program closing. Reference Style is used to turn on/off the R1C1 reference style. By default, this option is disabled and the A1 reference style is used. When the A1 reference style is used, columns are designated by letters, and rows are designated by numbers. If you select the cell located in row 3 and column 2, its address displayed in the box to the left of the the formula bar looks like this: B3. If the R1C1 reference style is enabled, both rows and columns are designated by numbers. If you select the cell at the intersection of row 3 and column 2, its address will look like this: R3C2. Letter R indicates the row number and letter C indicates the column number. In case you refer to other cells using the R1C1 reference style, the reference to a target cell is formed based on the distance from an active cell. For example, when you select the cell in row 5 and column 1 and refer to the cell in row 3 and column 2, the reference is R[-2]C[1]. Numbers in square brackets designate the position of the cell you refer to relative to the current cell position, i.e. the target cell is 2 rows up and 1 column to the right of the active cell. If you select the cell in row 1 and column 2 and refer to the same cell in row 3 and column 2, the reference is R[2]C, i.e. the target cell is 2 rows down from the active cell and in the same column. Co-editing Mode is used to select the display of the changes made during the co-editing: By default the Fast mode is selected, the users who take part in the document co-editing will see the changes in real time once they are made by other users. If you prefer not to see other user changes (so that they do not disturb you, or for some other reason), select the Strict mode and all the changes will be shown only after you click the Save icon notifying you that there are changes from other users. Default Zoom Value is used to set the default zoom value selecting it in the list of available options from 50% to 200%. Font Hinting is used to select the type a font is displayed in Spreadsheet Editor: Choose As Windows if you like the way fonts are usually displayed on Windows, i.e. using Windows font hinting. Choose As OS X if you like the way fonts are usually displayed on a Mac, i.e. without any font hinting at all. Choose Native if you want your text to be displayed with the hinting embedded into font files. Unit of Measurement is used to specify what units are used for measuring elements parameters such as width, height, spacing, margins etc. You can select the Centimeter, Point, or Inch option. Formula Language is used to select the language for displaying and entering formula names. Regional Settings is used to select the default display format for currency and date and time. Separator is used to specify the characters that you want to use as separators for decimals and thousands. The Use separators based on regional settings option is selected by default. If you want to use custom separators, uncheck this box and enter the necessary characters in the Decimal separator and Thousands separator fields below.

The Columns tab allows to add columns of text within the autoshape specifying the necessary Number of columns (up to 16) and Spacing between columns. Once you click OK, the text that already exists or any other text you enter within the autoshape will appear in columns and will flow from one column to another. The Cell Snapping tab contains the following parameters: Move and size with cells - this option allows to snap the shape to the cell behind it. If the cell moves (e.g. if you insert or delete some rows/columns), the shape will be moved together with the cell. If you increase or decrease the width or height of the cell, the shape will change its size as well. Move but don't size with cells - this option allows to snap the shape to the cell behind it preventing the image from being resized. If the cell moves, the shape will be moved together with the cell, but if you change the cell size, the shape dimensions remain unchanged. Don't move or size with cells - this option allows to prevent the shape from being moved or resized if the cell position or size was changed. The Alternative Text tab allows to specify a Title and Description which will be read to the people with vision or cognitive impairments to help them better understand what information there is in the shape. Insert and format text within the autoshape To insert a text into the autoshape select the shape with the mouse and start typing your text. The text you add in this way becomes a part of the autoshape (when you move or rotate the shape, the text moves or rotates with it). All the formatting options you can apply to the text within the autoshape are listed here. Join autoshapes using connectors You can connect autoshapes using lines with connection points to demonstrate dependencies between the objects (e.g. if you want to create a flowchart). To do that, click the Shape icon at the Insert tab of the top toolbar, select the Lines group from the menu, click the necessary shape within the selected group (excepting the last three shapes which are not connectors, namely Curve, Scribble and Freeform), hover the mouse cursor over the first autoshape and click one of the connection points that appear on the shape outline, drag the mouse cursor towards the second autoshape and click the necessary connection point on its outline. If you move the joined autoshapes, the connector remains attached to the shapes and moves together with them. You can also detach the connector from the shapes and then attach it to any other connection points."

If necessary, you can change the chart size and position. To delete the inserted chart, click it and press the Delete key. Edit sparklines Sparkline is a little chart that fits in one cell. Sparklines can be useful if you want to visually represent information for each row or column in large data sets. This makes it easier to show trends in multiple data series. If your spreadsheet contains existing sparklines created using some other application, you can change sparkline properties. To do that, select the cell that contains a sparkline with the mouse and click the Chart settings icon at the right sidebar. If the selected sparkline is included into a sparkline group, the changes will be applied to all sparklines in the group. Use the Type drop-down list to select one of the available sparkline types: Column - this type is similar to a regular Column Chart. Line - this type is similar to a regular Line Chart. Win/Loss - this type is suitable for representing data that include both positive and negative values. In the Style section, you can do the following: select the style which suits you best from the Template drop-down list. choose the necessary Color for the sparkline. choose the necessary Line Weight (available for the Line type only). The Show section allows to select which sparkline elements you want to highlight so that make them clearly visible. Check the box to the left of the element to be highlighted and select the necessary color clicking the colored box: High Point - to highlight points that represent maximum values, Low Point - to highlight points that represent minimum values, Negative Point - to highlight points that represent negative values, First/Last Point - to highlight the point that represents the first/last value, Markers (available for the Line type only) - to highlight all values. Click the Show advanced settings link situated at the right-side panel to open the Sparkline - Advanced Settings window. The Type &amp Data tab allows you to change the sparkline Type and Style as well as specify the Hidden and Empty cells display settings: Show empty cells as - this option allows to control how sparklines are displayed if some cells in a data range are empty. Select the necessary option from the list: Gaps - to display the sparkline with gaps in place of missing data, Zero - to display the sparkline as if the value in an empty cell was zero, Connect data points with line (available for the Line type only) - to ignore empty cells and display a connecting line between data points. Show data in hidden rows and columns - check this box if you want to include values from the hidden cells into sparklines. The Axis Options tab allows you to specify the following Horizontal/Vertical Axis parameters: In the Horizontal Axis section, the following parameters are available: Show axis - check this box to display the horizontal axis. If the source data contain negative values, this option helps to display them more vividly. Reverse order - check this box to display data in the reverse sequence. In the Vertical Axis section, the following parameters are available: Minimum/Maximum Value Auto for Each - this option is selected by default. It allows to use own minimum/maximum values for each sparkline. The minimum/maximum values are taken from the separate data series that are used to plot each sparkline. The maximum value for each sparkline will be located on the top of the cell, and the minimum value will be on the bottom. Same for All - this option allows to use the same minimum/maximum value for the entire sparkline group. The minimum/maximum values are taken from the whole data range that is used to plot the sparkline group. The maximum/minimum values for each sparkline will be scaled relative to the highest/lowest value within the range. If you select this option, it will be easier to compare several sparklines. Fixed - this option allows to set a custom minimum/maximum value. The values which are lower or higher than the specified ones are not displayed in the sparklines."

Add a new equation To insert an equation from the gallery, switch to the Insert tab of the top toolbar, click the arrow next to the Equation icon at the top toolbar, in the opened drop-down list select the equation category you need. The following categories are currently available: Symbols, Fractions, Scripts, Radicals, Integrals, Large Operators, Brackets, Functions, Accents, Limits and Logarithms, Operators, Matrices, click the certain symbol/equation in the corresponding set of templates. The selected symbol/equation will be added to the worksheet. The upper left corner of the equation box will coincide with the upper left corner of the currently selected cell, but the equation box can be freely moved, resized or rotated on the sheet. To do that click on the equation box border (it will be displayed as a solid line) and use corresponding handles. Each equation template represents a set of slots. Slot is a position for each element that makes up the equation. An empty slot (also called as a placeholder) has a dotted outline . You need to fill in all the placeholders specifying the necessary values. Enter values The insertion point specifies where the next character you enter will appear. To position the insertion point precisely, click within a placeholder and use the keyboard arrows to move the insertion point by one character left/right. Once the insertion point is positioned, you can fill in the placeholder: enter the desired numeric/literal value using the keyboard, insert a special character using the Symbols palette from the Equation menu at the Insert tab of the top toolbar, add another equation template from the palette to create a complex nested equation. The size of the primary equation will be automatically adjusted to fit its content. The size of the nested equation elements depends on the primary equation placeholder size, but it cannot be smaller than the sub-subscript size. To add some new equation elements you can also use the right-click menu options: To add a new argument that goes before or after the existing one within Brackets, you can right-click on the existing argument and select the Insert argument before/after option from the menu. To add a new equation within Cases with several conditions from the Brackets group, you can right-click on an empty placeholder or entered equation within it and select the Insert equation before/after option from the menu.

To do this, set the Height and Width parameters on Auto and use the «+» and «-» buttons to change the scale of the worksheet. The borders of the printing page will be covered with dashed lines on the spreadsheet, on the File tab, click Print, or use the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl + P and in the following window adjust the print settings. For example, if there are many columns on a sheet, it might be useful to change the Page Orientation to Portrait. Or print a pre-selected range of cells. Find out more about print settings in this article. Note: keep in mind, however, that the printout may be difficult to read because the editor shrinks the data to fit."

        "body": "Sort Data You can quickly sort your data in a spreadsheet using one of the available options: Ascending is used to sort your data in ascending order - A to Z alphabetically or smallest to largest for numerical data. Descending is used to sort your data in descending order - Z to A alphabetically or largest to smallest for numerical data. Note: the Sort options are accessible from both Home and Data tab. To sort your data, select a range of cells you wish to sort (you can select a single cell in a range to sort the entire range), click the Sort ascending icon situated at the Home or Data tab of the top toolbar to sort your data in ascending order, OR click the Sort descending icon situated at the Home or Data tab of the top toolbar to sort your data in descending order. Note: if you select a single column/row within a cell range or a part of the column/row, you will be asked if you want to expand the selection to include adjacent cells or sort the selected data only. You can also sort your data using the contextual menu options. Right-click the selected range of cells, select the Sort option from the menu and then select Ascending or Descending option from the submenu. It's also possible to sort the data by a color using the contextual menu: right-click a cell containing the color you want to sort your data by, select the Sort option from the menu, select the necessary option from the submenu: Selected Cell Color on top - to display the entries with the same cell background color on the top of the column, Selected Font Color on top - to display the entries with the same font color on the top of the column. Filter Data To display only the rows that meet certain criteria and hide other ones, make use of the Filter option. Note: the Filter options are accessible from both Home and Data tab. To enable a filter, Select a range of cells containing data to filter (you can select a single cell in a range to filter the entire range), Click the Filter icon situated at the Home or Data tab of the top toolbar. The drop-down arrow will appear in the first cell of each column of the selected cell range. It means that the filter is enabled. To apply a filter, Click the drop-down arrow . The Filter option list will open: Note: you can adjust the filter window size by dragging its right border to the right or to the left to display the data as convenient as possible. Adjust the filter parameters. You can proceed in one of the following three ways: select the data to display, filter data by certain criteria or filter data by color. Select the data to display Uncheck the boxes near the data you need to hide. For your convenience all the data wintin the Filter option list are sorted in ascending order. The number of unique values in the filtered range is displayed to the right of each value within the filter window. Note: the {Blanks} check box corresponds to the empty cells. It is available if the selected range of cells contains at least one empty cell. To facilitate the process make use of the search field on the top. Enter your query, entirely or partially, in the field - the values that include these characters will be displayed in the list below. The following two options will also be available: Select All Search Results - is checked by default. It allows to select all the values that correspond to your query in the list. Add current selection to filter - if you check this box, the selected values will not be hidden when you apply the filter. After you select all the necessary data, click the OK button in the Filter option list to apply the filter. Filter data by certain criteria Depending on the data contained in the selected column, you can choose either the Number filter or the Text filter option in the right part of the Filter options list, and then select one of the options from the submenu: For the Number filter the following options are available: Equals..., Does not equal..., Greater than..., Greater than or equal to..., Less than..., Less than or equal to..., Between, Top 10, Above Average, Below Average, Custom Filter.... For the Text filter the following options are available: Equals..., Does not equal..., Begins with..., Does not begin with..., Ends with..., Does not end with..., Contains..., Does not contain..., Custom Filter.... After you select one of the above options (apart from the Top 10 and Above/Below Average ones), the Custom Filter window will open. The corresponding criterion will be selected in the upper drop-down list. Enter the necessary value in the field on the right. To add one more criterion, use the And radiobutton if you need the data to satisfy both criteria or click the Or radiobutton if either or both criteria can be satisfied. Then select the second criterion from the lower drop-down list and enter the necessary value on the right. Click OK to apply the filter. If you choose the Custom Filter... option from the Number/Text filter option list, the first criterion is not selected automatically, you can set it yourself. If you choose the Top 10 option from the Number filter option list, a new window will open: The first drop-down list allows to choose if you wish to display the highest (Top) or lowest (Bottom) values. The second field allows to specify how many entries from the list or which percent of the overall entries number you want to display (you can enter a number from 1 to 500). The third drop-down list allows to set units of measure: Item or Percent. Once the necessary parameters are set, click OK to apply the filter. If you choose the Above/Below Average option from the Number filter option list, the filter will be applied right now. Filter data by color If the cell range you want to filter contains some cells you have formatted changing their background or font color (manually or using predefined styles), you can use one of the following options: Filter by cells color - to display only the entries with a certain cell background color and hide other ones, Filter by font color - to display only the entries with a certain cell font color and hide other ones. When you select the necessary option, a palette that contains colors used in the selected cell range will open. Choose one of the colors to apply the filter. The Filter button will appear in the first cell of the column. It means that the filter is applied. The number of filtered records will be displayed at the status bar (e.g. 25 of 80 records filtered). Note: when the filter is applied, the rows that are filtered out cannot be modified when autofilling, formatting, deleting the visible contents. Such actions affect the visible rows only, the rows that are hidden by the filter remain unchanged. When copying and pasting the filtered data, only visible rows can be copied and pasted. This is not equivalent to manually hidden rows which are affected by all similar actions. Sort filtered data You can set the sorting order of the data you have enabled or applied filter for. Click the drop-down arrow or the Filter button and select one of the options in the Filter option list: Sort Lowest to Highest - allows to sort your data in ascending order, displaying the lowest value on the top of the column, Sort Highest to Lowest - allows to sort your data in descending order, displaying the highest value on the top of the column, Sort by cells color - allows to select one of the colors and display the entries with the same cell background color on the top of the column, Sort by font color - allows to select one of the colors and display the entries with the same font color on the top of the column. The latter two options can be used if the cell range you want to sort contains some cells you have formatted changing their background or font color (manually or using predefined styles). The sorting direction will be indicated by an arrow in the filter buttons. if the data is sorted in ascending order, the drop-down arrow in the first cell of the column looks like this: and the Filter button looks the following way: . if the data is sorted in descending order, the drop-down arrow in the first cell of the column looks like this: and the Filter button looks the following way: . You can also quickly sort the data by a color using the contextual menu options: right-click a cell containing the color you want to sort your data by, select the Sort option from the menu, select the necessary option from the submenu: Selected Cell Color on top - to display the entries with the same cell background color on the top of the column, Selected Font Color on top - to display the entries with the same font color on the top of the column. Filter by the selected cell contents You can also quickly filter your data by the selected cell contents using the contextual menu options. Right-click a cell, select the Filter option from the menu and then select one of the available options: Filter by Selected cell's value - to display only the entries with the same value as the selected cell contains. Filter by cell's color - to display only the entries with the same cell background color as the selected cell has. Filter by font color - to display only the entries with the same cell font color as the selected cell has. Format as Table Template To facilitate the work with your data Spreadsheet Editor allows you to apply a table template to a selected cell range automatically enabling the filter. To do that, select a range of cells you need to format, click the Format as table template icon situated at the Home tab of the top toolbar. select the template you need in the gallery, in the opened pop-up window check the range of cells to be formatted as a table, check the Title if you wish the table headers to be included in the selected range of cells, otherwise the header row will be added at the top while the selected range of cells will be moved one row down, click the OK button to apply the selected template. The template will be applied to the selected range of cells and you will be able to edit the table headers and apply the filter to work with your data. It's also possible to insert a formatted table using the Table button at the Insert tab. In this case, the default table template is applied. Note: once you create a new formatted table, a default name (Table1, Table2 etc.) will be automatically assigned to the table. You can change this name making it more meaningful and use it for further work. If you enter a new value in a cell below the table last row (if the table does not have the Total row) or in a cell to the right of the table last column, the formatted table will be automatically extended to include a new row or column. If you do not want to expand the table, click the button that appears and select the Undo table autoexpansion option. Once you undo this action, the Redo table autoexpansion option will be available in this menu. Some of the table settings can be altered using the Table settings tab of the right sidebar that opens if you select at least one cell within the table with the mouse and click the Table settings icon on the right. The Rows and Columns sections on the top allow you to emphasize certain rows/columns applying a specific formatting to them, or highlight different rows/columns with the different background colors to clearly distinguish them. The following options are available: Header - allows to display the header row. Total - adds the Summary row at the bottom of the table. Banded - enables the background color alternation for odd and even rows. Filter button - allows to display the drop-down arrows in the header row cells. This option is only available when the Header option is selected. First - emphasizes the leftmost column in the table with a special formatting. Last - emphasizes the rightmost column in the table with a special formatting. Banded - enables the background color alternation for odd and even columns. The Select From Template section allows you to choose one of the predefined tables styles. Each template combines certain formatting parameters, such as a background color, border style, row/column banding etc. Depending on the options checked in the Rows and/or Columns sections above, the templates set will be displayed differently. For example, if you've checked the Header option in the Rows section and the Banded option in the Columns section, the displayed templates list will include only templates with the header row and banded columns enabled: If you want to clear the current table style (background color, borders etc.) without removing the table itself, apply the None template from the template list: The Resize table section allows you to change the cell range the table formatting is applied to. Click the Select Data button - a new pop-up window will open. Change the link to the cell range in the entry field or select the necessary cell range on the worksheet with the mouse and click the OK button. The Rows & Columns section allows you to perform the following operations: Select a row, column, all columns data excluding the header row, or the entire table including the header row. Insert a new row above or below the selected one as well as a new column to the left or to the right of the selected one. Delete a row, column (depending on the cursor position or the selection), or the entire table. Note: the options of the Rows & Columns section are also accessible from the right-click menu. The Convert to range button can be used if you want to transform the table into a regular data range removing the filter but preserving the table style (i.e. cell and font colors etc.). Once you apply this option, the Table settings tab at the right sidebar will be unavailable. To change the advanced table properties, use the Show advanced settings link at the right sidebar. The table properties window will open: The Alternative Text tab allows to specify a Title and Description which will be read to the people with vision or cognitive impairments to help them better understand what information there is in the table. Reapply Filter If the filtered data has been changed, you can refresh the filter to display an up-to-date result: click the Filter button in the first cell of the column that contains the filtered data, select the Reapply option in the Filter option list that opens. You can also right-click a cell within the column that contains the filtered data and select the Reapply option from the contextual menu. Clear Filter To clear the filter, click the Filter button in the first cell of the column that contains the filtered data, select the Clear option in the Filter option list that opens. You can also proceed in the following way: select the range of cells containing the filtered data, click the Clear filter icon situated at the Home or Data tab of the top toolbar. The filter will remain enabled, but all the applied filter parameters will be removed, and the Filter buttons in the first cells of the columns will change into the drop-down arrows . Remove Filter To remove the filter, select the range of cells containing the filtered data, click the Filter icon situated at the Home or Data tab of the top toolbar. The filter will be disabled, and the drop-down arrows will disappear from the first cells of the columns. Sort data by several columns/rows To sort data by several columns/rows you can create several sorting levels using the Custom Sort function. select a range of cells you wish to sort (you can select a single cell in a range to sort the entire range), click the Custom Sort icon situated at the Data tab of the top toolbar, the Sort window opens. Sorting by columns is selected by default. To change sort orientation (i.e. sort data by rows instead of columns) click the Options button on the top. The Sort Options window will open: check the My data has headers box, if necessary, choose the necessary Orientation: Sort top to bottom to sort data by columns or Sort left to right to sort data by rows, click OK to apply the changes and close the window. set the first sorting level in the Sort by field: in the Column / Row section, select the first column / row you want to sort, in the Sort on list choose one of the following options: Values, Cell color, or Font color, in the Order list, specify the necessary sorting order. The available options differ depending on the option chosen in the Sort on list: if the Values option is selected, choose the Ascending / Descending option if the cell range contains numbers or A to Z / Z to A option if the cell range contains text values, if the Cell color option is selected, choose the necessary cell color and select the Top / Below option for columns or Left / Right option for rows, if the Font color option is selected, choose the necessary font color and select the Top / Below option for columns or Left / Right option for rows. add the next sorting level by clicking the Add level button, select the second column / row you want to sort and specify other sorting parameters in the Then by field as described above. If necessary, add more levels in the same way. manage the added levels using the buttons at the top of the window: Delete level, Copy level or change the level order by using the arrow buttons Move the level up / Move the level down, click OK to apply the changes and close the window. The data will be sorted according to the specified sorting levels."

        "title": "Use named ranges", 
        "body": "Names are meaningful notations that can be assigned for a cell or cell range and used to simplify working with formulas. Creating a formula, you can insert a name as its argument instead of using a reference to a cell range. For example, if you assign the Annual_Income name for a cell range, it will be possible to enter =SUM(Annual_Income) instead of =SUM(B1:B12). In such a form, formulas become clearer. This feature can also be useful in case a lot of formulas are referred to one and the same cell range. If the range address is changed, you can make the correction once using the Name Manager instead of editing all the formulas one by one. There are two types of names that can be used: Defined name – an arbitrary name that you can specify for a certain cell range. Defined names also include the names created automatically when setting up print areas. Table name – a default name that is automatically assigned to a new formatted table (Table1, Table2 etc.). You can edit such a name later. Names are also classified by Scope, i.e. the location where a name is recognized. A name can be scoped to the whole workbook (it will be recognized for any worksheet within this workbook) or to a separate worksheet (it will be recognized for the specified worksheet only). Each name must be unique within a single scope, the same names can be used within different scopes. Create new names To create a new defined name for a selection: Select a cell or cell range you want to assign a name to. Open a new name window in a suitable way: Right-click the selection and choose the Define Name option from the contextual menu, or click the Named ranges icon at the Home tab of the top toolbar and select the New name option from the menu. The New Name window will open: Enter the necessary Name in the text entry field. Note: a name cannot start from a number, contain spaces or punctuation marks. Underscores (_) are allowed. Case does not matter. Specify the name Scope. The Workbook scope is selected by default, but you can specify an individual worksheet selecting it from the list. Check the selected Data Range address. If necessary, you can change it. Click the Select Data button - the Select Data Range window will open. Change the link to the cell range in the entry field or select a new range on the worksheet with the mouse and click OK. Click OK to save the new name. To quickly create a new name for the selected range of cells, you can also enter the desired name into the name box located to the left of the the formula bar and press Enter. A name created in such a way is scoped to the Workbook. Manage names All the existing names can be accessed via the Name Manager. To open it: click the Named ranges icon at the Home tab of the top toolbar and select the Name manager option from the menu, or click the arrow in the name field and select the Name Manager option. The Name Manager window will open: For your convenience, you can filter the names selecting the name category you want to be displayed: All, Defined names, Table names, Names Scoped to Sheet or Names Scoped to Workbook. The names that belong to the selected category will be displayed in the list, the other names will be hidden. To change the sort order for the displayed list you can click on the Named Ranges or Scope titles in this window. To edit a name, select it in the list and click the Edit button. The Edit Name window will open: For a defined name, you can change the name and the data range it refers to. For a table name, you can change the name only. When all the necessary changes are made, click OK to apply them. To discard the changes, click Cancel. If the edited name is used in a formula, the formula will be automatically changed accordingly. To delete a name, select it in the list and click the Delete button. Note: if you delete the name that is used in a formula, the formula will no longer work (it will return the #NAME? error). You can also create a new name in the Name Manager window by clicking the New button. Use names when working with the spreadsheet To quickly navigate between cell ranges you can click the arrow in the name box and select the necessary name from the name list – the data range that corresponds to this name will be selected on the worksheet. Note: the name list displays the defined names and table names scoped to the current worksheet and to the whole workbook. To add a name as an argument of a formula: Place the insertion point where you need to add a name. Do one of the following: enter the name of the necessary named range manually using the keyboard. Once you type the initial letters, the Formula Autocomplete list will be displayed. As you type, the items (formulas and names) that match the entered characters are displayed in it. You can select the necessary name from the list and insert it into the formula by double-clicking it or pressing the Tab key. or click the Named ranges icon at the Home tab of the top toolbar, select the Paste name option from the menu, choose the necessary name from the Paste Name window and click OK: Note: the Paste Name window displays the defined names and table names scoped to the current worksheet and to the whole workbook."
