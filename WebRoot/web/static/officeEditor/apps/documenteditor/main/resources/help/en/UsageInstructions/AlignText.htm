			<h1>Align your text in a paragraph</h1>
			<p>The text is commonly aligned in four ways: left, right, center or justified. To do that,</p>
			<ol>
				<li>place the cursor to the position where you want the alignment to be applied (this can be a new line or already entered text),</li>
                <li>switch to the <b>Home</b> tab of the top toolbar,</li>
				<li>select the alignment type you would like to apply:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Left</b> alignment with the text lined up by the left side of the page (the right side remains unaligned) is done with the <b>Align left</b> <img alt="Align left icon" src="../images/alignleft.png" /> icon situated at the top toolbar.</li>
						<li><b>Center</b> alignment with the text lined up by the center of the page (the right and the left sides remains unaligned) is done with the <b>Align center</b> <img alt="Align center icon" src="../images/aligncenter.png" /> icon situated at the top toolbar.</li>
						<li><b>Right</b> alignment with the text lined up by the right side of the page (the left side remains unaligned) is done with the <b>Align right</b> <img alt="Align right icon" src="../images/alignright.png" /> icon situated at the top toolbar.</li>
						<li><b>Justified</b> alignment with the text lined up by both the left and the right sides of the page (additional spacing is added where necessary to keep the alignment) is done with the <b>Justified</b> <img alt="Justify icon" src="../images/justify.png" /> icon situated at the top toolbar.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
            <p>The alignment parameters are also available at the <b>Paragraph - Advanced Settings</b> window.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>right-click the text and choose the <b>Paragraph Advanced Settings</b> option from the contextual menu or use the <b>Show advanced settings</b> option at the right sidebar,</li>
                <li>open the <b>Paragraph - Advanced Settings</b> window, switch to the <b>Indents &amp; Spacing</b> tab,</li>
                <li>select one of the alignment types from the <b>Alignment</b> list: <b>Left</b>, <b>Center</b>, <b>Right</b>, <b>Justified</b>,</li>
                <li>click the <b>OK</b> button, to apply the changes.</li>
            </ol>
