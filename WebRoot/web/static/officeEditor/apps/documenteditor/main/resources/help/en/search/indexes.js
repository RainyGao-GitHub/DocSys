If you need to compare and merge two documents, you can use the document Compare feature. It allows to display the differences between two documents and merge the documents by accepting the changes one by one or all at once. After comparing and merging two documents, the result will be stored on the portal as a new version of the original file. If you do not need to merge documents which are being compared, you can reject all the changes so that the original document remains unchanged.

To navigate between the Documents module sections use the menu in the left part of the window. Select the necessary .docx document and click the OK button. When the second document for comparison is selected, the comparison process will start and the document will look as if it was opened in the Review mode.

Additional info on the comparison feature Method of the comparison Documents are compared by words. If a word contains a change of at least one character (e.g. if a character was removed or replaced), in the result, the difference will be displayed as the change of the entire word, not the character. The image below illustrates the case when the original file contains the word 'Characters' and the document for comparison contains the word 'Character'. Authorship of the document When the comparison process is launched, the second document for comparison is being loaded and compared to the current one. If the loaded document contains some data which is not represented in the original document, the data will be marked as added by a reviewer. If the original document contains some data which is not represented in the loaded document, the data will be marked as deleted by a reviewer. If the authors of the original and loaded documents are the same person, the reviewer is the same user. His/her name is displayed in the change balloon. If the authors of two files are different users, then the author of the second file loaded for comparison is the author of the added/removed changes. Presence of the tracked changes in the compared document If the original document contains some changes made in the review mode, they will be accepted in the comparison process. When you choose the second file for comparison, you'll see the corresponding warning message. In this case, when you choose the Original display mode, the document will not contain any changes."

The function returns 1 if the value is defined and calculated without errors and returns 0 if the value is not defined or calculated with an error. =DEFINED(A1) Logical FALSE() The function returns 0 (FALSE) and does not require any argument. =FALSE Returns 0 Mathematical INT(x) The function is used to analyze and return the integer part of the specified number. =INT(2.5) Returns 2 Statistical MAX(number1, number2, ...) The function is used to analyze the range of data and find the largest number. =MAX(15,18,6) Returns 18 Statistical MIN(number1, number2, ...) The function is used to analyze the range of data and find the smallest number. =MIN(15,18,6) Returns 6 Mathematical MOD(x, y) The function is used to return the remainder after the division of a number by the specified divisor. =MOD(6,3) Returns 0 Logical NOT(logical) The function is used to check if the logical value you enter is TRUE or FALSE. The function returns 1 (TRUE) if the argument is FALSE and 0 (FALSE) if the argument is TRUE. =NOT(2&lt;5) Returns 0 Logical OR(logical1, logical2, ...) The function is used to check if the logical value you enter is TRUE or FALSE. The function returns 0 (FALSE) if all the arguments are FALSE. =OR(1&gt;0,1&gt;3) Returns 1 Mathematical PRODUCT(argument-list) The function is used to multiply all the numbers in the selected range of cells and return the product. =PRODUCT(2,5) Returns 10 Mathematical ROUND(x, num_digits) The function is used to round the number to the desired number of digits. =ROUND(2.25,1) Returns 2.3 Mathematical SIGN(x) The function is used to return the sign of a number. If the number is positive, the function returns 1. If the number is negative, the function returns -1.

Font size Is used to select among the preset font size values from the dropdown list (the default values are: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 36, 48, 72 and 96). It's also possible to manually enter a custom value to the font size field and then press Enter. Increment font size Is used to change the font size making it larger one point each time the button is pressed. Decrement font size Is used to change the font size making it smaller one point each time the button is pressed. Highlight color Is used to mark separate sentences, phrases, words, or even characters by adding a color band that imitates highlighter pen effect around the text. You can select the necessary part of the text and then click the downward arrow next to the icon to select a color on the palette (this color set does not depend on the selected Color scheme and includes 16 colors) - the color will be applied to the text selection. Alternatively, you can first choose a highlight color and then start selecting the text with the mouse - the mouse pointer will look like this and you'll be able to highlight several different parts of your text sequentially. To stop highlighting just click the icon once again. To clear the highlight color, choose the No Fill option. Highlight color is different from the Background color as the latter is applied to the whole paragraph and completely fills all the paragraph space from the left page margin to the right page margin. Font color Is used to change the color of the letters/characters in the text. By default, the automatic font color is set in a new blank document. It is displayed as a black font on the white background. If you change the background color into black, the font color will automatically change into white to keep the text clearly visible. To choose a different color, click the downward arrow next to the icon and select a color from the available palettes (the colors on the Theme Colors palette depend on the selected color scheme). After you change the default font color, you can use the Automatic option in the color palettes window to quickly restore the automatic color for the selected text passage.

        "title": "Apply formatting styles", 
        "body": "Each formatting style is a set of predefined formatting options: (font size, color, line spacing, alignment etc.). The styles allow you to quickly format different parts of the document (headings, subheadings, lists, normal text, quotes) instead of applying several formatting options individually each time. This also ensures a consistent appearance throughout the entire document. Style application depends on whether a style is a paragraph style (normal, no spacing, headings, list paragraph etc.), or the text style (based on the font type, size, color), as well as on whether a text passage is selected, or the mouse cursor is positioned within a word. In some cases you might need to select the necessary style from the style library twice so that it can be applied correctly: when you click the style at the style panel for the first time, the paragraph style properties are applied. When you click it for the second time, the text properties are applied. Use default styles To apply one of the available text formatting styles, place the cursor within the paragraph you need, or select several paragraphs you want to apply one of the formatting styles to, select the needed style from the style gallery on the right at the Home tab of the top toolbar. The following formatting styles are available: normal, no spacing, heading 1-9, title, subtitle, quote, intense quote, list paragraph, footer, header, footnote text. Edit existing styles and create new ones To change an existing style: Apply the necessary style to a paragraph. Select the paragraph text and change all the formatting parameters you need. Save the changes made: right-click the edited text, select the Formatting as Style option and then choose the Update 'StyleName' Style option ('StyleName' corresponds to the style you've applied at the step 1), or select the edited text passage with the mouse, drop-down the style gallery, right-click the style you want to change and select the Update from selection option. Once the style is modified, all the paragraphs within the document formatted using this style will change their appearance correspondingly. To create a completely new style: Format a text passage as you need. Select an appropriate way to save the style: right-click the edited text, select the Formatting as Style option and then choose the Create new Style option, or select the edited text passage with the mouse, drop-down the style gallery and click the New style from selection option. Set the new style parameters in the Create New Style window that opens: Specify the new style name in the text entry field. Select the desired style for the subsequent paragraph from the Next paragraph style list. It's also possible to choose the Same as created new style option. Click the OK button. The created style will be added to the style gallery. Manage your custom styles: To restore the default settings of a certain style you've changed, right-click the style you want to restore and select the Restore to default option. To restore the default settings of all the styles you've changed, right-click any default style in the style gallery and select the Restore all to default styles option. To delete one of the new styles you've created, right-click the style you want to delete and select the Delete style option. To delete all the new styles you've created, right-click any new style you've created and select the Delete all custom styles option."

Note: to add a caption within the autoshape make sure the shape is selected on the page and start typing your text. The text you add in this way becomes a part of the autoshape (when you move or rotate the shape, the text moves or rotates with it). It's also possible to add a caption to the autoshape. To learn more on how to work with captions for autoshapes, you can refer to this article. Move and resize autoshapes To change the autoshape size, drag small squares situated on the shape edges. To maintain the original proportions of the selected autoshape while resizing, hold down the Shift key and drag one of the corner icons.</pid> When modifying some shapes, for example figured arrows or callouts, the yellow diamond-shaped icon is also available. It allows you to adjust some aspects of the shape, for example, the length of the head of an arrow. To alter the autoshape position, use the icon that appears after hovering your mouse cursor over the autoshape. Drag the autoshape to the necessary position without releasing the mouse button. When you move the autoshape, guide lines are displayed to help you position the object on the page precisely (if a wrapping style other than inline is selected). To move the autoshape by one-pixel increments, hold down the Ctrl key and use the keybord arrows. To move the autoshape strictly horizontally/vertically and prevent it from moving in a perpendicular direction, hold down the Shift key when dragging. To rotate the autoshape, hover the mouse cursor over the rotation handle and drag it clockwise or counterclockwise. To constrain the rotation angle to 15 degree increments, hold down the Shift key while rotating. Note: the list of keyboard shortcuts that can be used when working with objects is available here. Adjust autoshape settings To align and arrange autoshapes, use the right-click menu. The menu options are: Cut, Copy, Paste - standard options which are used to cut or copy a selected text/object and paste a previously cut/copied text passage or object to the current cursor position. Arrange is used to bring the selected autoshape to foreground, send to background, move forward or backward as well as group or ungroup shapes to perform operations with several of them at once. To learn more on how to arrange objects you can refer to this page. Align is used to align the shape left, center, right, top, middle, bottom. To learn more on how to align objects you can refer to this page. Wrapping Style is used to select a text wrapping style from the available ones - inline, square, tight, through, top and bottom, in front, behind - or edit the wrap boundary.

Style - choose one of the available options: Linear (colors change in a straight line i.e. along a horizontal/vertical axis or diagonally at a 45 degree angle) or Radial (colors change in a circular path from the center to the edges). Direction - choose a template from the menu. If the Linear gradient is selected, the following directions are available: top-left to bottom-right, top to bottom, top-right to bottom-left, right to left, bottom-right to top-left, bottom to top, bottom-left to top-right, left to right. If the Radial gradient is selected, only one template is available. Gradient - click on the left slider under the gradient bar to activate the color box which corresponds to the first color. Click on the color box on the right to choose the first color in the palette. Drag the slider to set the gradient stop i.e. the point where one color changes into another. Use the right slider under the gradient bar to specify the second color and set the gradient stop. Picture or Texture - select this option to use an image or a predefined texture as the shape background. If you wish to use an image as a background for the shape, you can add an image From File selecting it on your computer HDD or From URL inserting the appropriate URL address into the opened window. If you wish to use a texture as a background for the shape, open the From Texture menu and select the necessary texture preset. Currently, the following textures are available: canvas, carton, dark fabric, grain, granite, grey paper, knit, leather, brown paper, papyrus, wood. In case the selected Picture has less or more dimensions than the autoshape has, you can choose the Stretch or Tile setting from the dropdown list. The Stretch option allows you to adjust the image size to fit the autoshape size so that it could fill the space completely. The Tile option allows you to display only a part of the bigger image keeping its original dimensions or repeat the smaller image keeping its original dimensions over the autoshape surface so that it could fill the space completely. Note: any selected Texture preset fills the space completely, but you can apply the Stretch effect if necessary. Pattern - select this option to fill the shape with a two-colored design composed of regularly repeated elements. Pattern - select one of the predefined designs from the menu. Foreground color - click this color box to change the color of the pattern elements. Background color - click this color box to change the color of the pattern background. No Fill - select this option if you don't want to use any fill. Opacity - use this section to set an Opacity level dragging the slider or entering the percent value manually. The default value is 100%. It corresponds to the full opacity. The 0% value corresponds to the full transparency. Stroke - use this section to change the autoshape stroke width, color or type. To change the stroke width, select one of the available options from the Size dropdown list. The available options are: 0.5 pt, 1 pt, 1.5 pt, 2.25 pt, 3 pt, 4.5 pt, 6 pt. Alternatively, select the No Line option if you don't want to use any stroke. To change the stroke color, click on the colored box below and select the necessary color. To change the stroke type, select the necessary option from the corresponding dropdown list (a solid line is applied by default, you can change it to one of the available dashed lines). Rotation is used to rotate the shape by 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise as well as to flip the shape horizontally or vertically. Click one of the buttons: to rotate the shape by 90 degrees counterclockwise to rotate the shape by 90 degrees clockwise to flip the shape horizontally (left to right) to flip the shape vertically (upside down) Wrapping Style - use this section to select a text wrapping style from the available ones - inline, square, tight, through, top and bottom, in front, behind (for more information see the advanced settings description below). Change Autoshape - use this section to replace the current autoshape with another one selected from the dropdown list. Show shadow - check this option to display shape with shadow. Adjust autoshape advanced settings To change the advanced settings of the autoshape, right-click it and select the Advanced Settings option in the menu or use the Show advanced settings link at the right sidebar. The 'Shape - Advanced Settings' window will open: The Size tab contains the following parameters: Width - use one of these options to change the autoshape width. Absolute - specify an exact value measured in absolute units i.e. Centimeters/Points/Inches (depending on the option specified at the File -> Advanced Settings... tab). Relative - specify a percentage relative to the left margin width, the margin (i.e. the distance between the left and right margins), the page width, or the right margin width. Height - use one of these options to change the autoshape height. Absolute - specify an exact value measured in absolute units i.e. Centimeters/Points/Inches (depending on the option specified at the File -> Advanced Settings... tab). Relative - specify a percentage relative to the margin (i.e. the distance between the top and bottom margins), the bottom margin height, the page height, or the top margin height. If the Lock aspect ratio option is checked, the width and height will be changed together preserving the original shape aspect ratio. The Rotation tab contains the following parameters: Angle - use this option to rotate the shape by an exactly specified angle. Enter the necessary value measured in degrees into the field or adjust it using the arrows on the right. Flipped - check the Horizontally box to flip the shape horizontally (left to right) or check the Vertically box to flip the shape vertically (upside down). The Text Wrapping tab contains the following parameters: Wrapping Style - use this option to change the way the shape is positioned relative to the text: it will either be a part of the text (in case you select the inline style) or bypassed by it from all sides (if you select one of the other styles). Inline - the shape is considered to be a part of the text, like a character, so when the text moves, the shape moves as well. In this case the positioning options are inaccessible. If one of the following styles is selected, the shape can be moved independently of the text and positioned on the page exactly: Square - the text wraps the rectangular box that bounds the shape. Tight - the text wraps the actual shape edges. Through - the text wraps around the shape edges and fills in the open white space within the shape. So that the effect can appear, use the Edit Wrap Boundary option from the right-click menu. Top and bottom - the text is only above and below the shape. In front - the shape overlaps the text. Behind - the text overlaps the shape. If you select the square, tight, through, or top and bottom style you will be able to set up some additional parameters - distance from text at all sides (top, bottom, left, right). The Position tab is available only if you select a wrapping style other than inline. This tab contains the following parameters that vary depending on the selected wrapping style: The Horizontal section allows you to select one of the following three autoshape positioning types: Alignment (left, center, right) relative to character, column, left margin, margin, page or right margin, Absolute Position measured in absolute units i.e. Centimeters/Points/Inches (depending on the option specified at the File -> Advanced Settings... tab) to the right of character, column, left margin, margin, page or right margin, Relative position measured in percent relative to the left margin, margin, page or right margin. The Vertical section allows you to select one of the following three autoshape positioning types: Alignment (top, center, bottom) relative to line, margin, bottom margin, paragraph, page or top margin, Absolute Position measured in absolute units i.e. Centimeters/Points/Inches (depending on the option specified at the File -> Advanced Settings... tab) below line, margin, bottom margin, paragraph, page or top margin, Relative position measured in percent relative to the margin, bottom margin, page or top margin. Move object with text controls whether the autoshape moves as the text to which it is anchored moves. Allow overlap controls whether two autoshapes overlap or not if you drag them near each other on the page. The Weights &amp; Arrows tab contains the following parameters: Line Style - this option group allows to specify the following parameters: Cap Type - this option allows to set the style for the end of the line, therefore it can be applied only to the shapes with the open outline, such as lines, polylines etc.: Flat - the end points will be flat. Round - the end points will be rounded. Square - the end points will be square. Join Type - this option allows to set the style for the intersection of two lines, for example, it can affect a polyline or the corners of the triangle or rectangle outline: Round - the corner will be rounded. Bevel - the corner will be cut off angularly. Miter - the corner will be pointed. It goes well to shapes with sharp angles. Note: the effect will be more noticeable if you use a large outline width. Arrows - this option group is available if a shape from the Lines shape group is selected. It allows to set the arrow Start and End Style and Size by selecting the appropriate option from the dropdown lists. The Text Padding tab allows to change the autoshape Top, Bottom, Left and Right internal margins (i.e. the distance between the text within the shape and the autoshape borders). Note: this tab is only available if text is added within the autoshape, otherwise the tab is disabled. The Alternative Text tab allows to specify a Title and Description which will be read to the people with vision or cognitive impairments to help them better understand what information there is in the shape."

The Gridlines section allows to specify which of the Horizontal/Vertical Gridlines you wish to display selecting the necessary option from the drop-down list: Major, Minor, or Major and Minor. You can hide the gridlines at all using the None option. Note: the Axis Settings and Gridlines sections will be disabled for Pie charts since charts of this type have no axes and gridlines. Note: the Vertical/Horizontal Axis tabs will be disabled for Pie charts since charts of this type have no axes. The Vertical Axis tab allows you to change the parameters of the vertical axis also referred to as the values axis or y-axis which displays numeric values. Note that the vertical axis will be the category axis which displays text labels for the Bar charts, therefore in this case the Vertical Axis tab options will correspond to the ones described in the next section. For the XY (Scatter) charts, both axes are value axes. The Axis Options section allows to set the following parameters: Minimum Value - is used to specify a lowest value displayed at the vertical axis start. The Auto option is selected by default, in this case the minimum value is calculated automatically depending on the selected data range. You can select the Fixed option from the drop-down list and specify a different value in the entry field on the right. Maximum Value - is used to specify a highest value displayed at the vertical axis end. The Auto option is selected by default, in this case the maximum value is calculated automatically depending on the selected data range. You can select the Fixed option from the drop-down list and specify a different value in the entry field on the right. Axis Crosses - is used to specify a point on the vertical axis where the horizontal axis should cross it. The Auto option is selected by default, in this case the axes intersection point value is calculated automatically depending on the selected data range. You can select the Value option from the drop-down list and specify a different value in the entry field on the right, or set the axes intersection point at the Minimum/Maximum Value on the vertical axis. Display Units - is used to determine a representation of the numeric values along the vertical axis. This option can be useful if you're working with great numbers and wish the values on the axis to be displayed in more compact and readable way (e.g. you can represent 50 000 as 50 by using the Thousands display units). Select desired units from the drop-down list: Hundreds, Thousands, 10 000, 100 000, Millions, 10 000 000, 100 000 000, Billions, Trillions, or choose the None option to return to the default units. Values in reverse order - is used to display values in an opposite direction. When the box is unchecked, the lowest value is at the bottom and the highest value is at the top of the axis. When the box is checked, the values are ordered from top to bottom. The Tick Options section allows to adjust the appearance of tick marks on the vertical scale. Major tick marks are the larger scale divisions which can have labels displaying numeric values. Minor tick marks are the scale subdivisions which are placed between the major tick marks and have no labels. Tick marks also define where gridlines can be displayed, if the corresponding option is set at the Layout tab. The Major/Minor Type drop-down lists contain the following placement options: None to not display major/minor tick marks, Cross to display major/minor tick marks on both sides of the axis, In to display major/minor tick marks inside the axis, Out to display major/minor tick marks outside the axis.

The Horizontal Axis tab allows you to change the parameters of the horizontal axis also referred to as the categories axis or x-axis which displays text labels. Note that the horizontal axis will be the value axis which displays numeric values for the Bar charts, therefore in this case the Horizontal Axis tab options will correspond to the ones described in the previous section. For the XY (Scatter) charts, both axes are value axes. The Axis Options section allows to set the following parameters: Axis Crosses - is used to specify a point on the horizontal axis where the vertical axis should cross it. The Auto option is selected by default, in this case the axes intersection point value is calculated automatically depending on the selected data range. You can select the Value option from the drop-down list and specify a different value in the entry field on the right, or set the axes intersection point at the Minimum/Maximum Value (that corresponds to the first and last category) on the horizontal axis. Axis Position - is used to specify where the axis text labels should be placed: On Tick Marks or Between Tick Marks. Values in reverse order - is used to display categories in an opposite direction. When the box is unchecked, categories are displayed from left to right. When the box is checked, the categories are ordered from right to left. The Tick Options section allows to adjust the appearance of tick marks on the horizontal scale. Major tick marks are the larger divisions which can have labels displaying category values. Minor tick marks are the smaller divisions which are placed between the major tick marks and have no labels.

The Label Options section allows to adjust the appearance of labels which display categories. Label Position - is used to specify where the labels should be placed in regard to the horizontal axis. Select the necessary option from the drop-down list: None to not display category labels, Low to display category labels at the bottom of the plot area, High to display category labels at the top of the plot area, Next to axis to display category labels next to the axis. Axis Label Distance - is used to specify how closely the labels should be placed to the axis. You can specify the necessary value in the entry field. The more the value you set, the more the distance between the axis and labels is. Interval between Labels - is used to specify how often the labels should be displayed. The Auto option is selected by default, in this case labels are displayed for every category. You can select the Manual option from the drop-down list and specify the necessary value in the entry field on the right. For example, enter 2 to display labels for every other category etc. The Alternative Text tab allows to specify a Title and Description which will be read to the people with vision or cognitive impairments to help them better understand what information there is in the chart. Move and resize charts Once the chart is added, you can change its size and position. To change the chart size, drag small squares situated on its edges. To maintain the original proportions of the selected chart while resizing, hold down the Shift key and drag one of the corner icons. To alter the chart position, use the icon that appears after hovering your mouse cursor over the chart. Drag the chart to the necessary position without releasing the mouse button.

Wrapping Style is used to select a text wrapping style from the available ones - inline, square, tight, through, top and bottom, in front, behind (for more information see the advanced settings description below). Change Chart Type is used to change the selected chart type and/or style. To select the necessary chart Style, use the second drop-down menu in the Change Chart Type section. Edit Data is used to open the 'Chart Editor' window. Note: to quickly open the 'Chart Editor' window you can also double-click the chart in the document. Some of these options you can also find in the right-click menu. The menu options are: Cut, Copy, Paste - standard options which are used to cut or copy a selected text/object and paste a previously cut/copied text passage or object to the current cursor position. Arrange is used to bring the selected chart to foreground, send to background, move forward or backward as well as group or ungroup charts to perform operations with several of them at once. To learn more on how to arrange objects you can refer to this page. Align is used to align the chart left, center, right, top, middle, bottom. To learn more on how to align objects you can refer to this page. Wrapping Style is used to select a text wrapping style from the available ones - inline, square, tight, through, top and bottom, in front, behind.

The chart properties window will open: The Size tab contains the following parameters: Width and Height - use these options to change the chart width and/or height. If the Constant Proportions button is clicked (in this case it looks like this ), the width and height will be changed together preserving the original chart aspect ratio. The Text Wrapping tab contains the following parameters: Wrapping Style - use this option to change the way the chart is positioned relative to the text: it will either be a part of the text (in case you select the inline style) or bypassed by it from all sides (if you select one of the other styles). Inline - the chart is considered to be a part of the text, like a character, so when the text moves, the chart moves as well. In this case the positioning options are inaccessible. If one of the following styles is selected, the chart can be moved independently of the text and positioned on the page exactly: Square - the text wraps the rectangular box that bounds the chart. Tight - the text wraps the actual chart edges. Through - the text wraps around the chart edges and fills in the open white space within the chart. Top and bottom - the text is only above and below the chart. In front - the chart overlaps the text. Behind - the text overlaps the chart. If you select the square, tight, through, or top and bottom style you will be able to set up some additional parameters - distance from text at all sides (top, bottom, left, right). The Position tab is available only if you select a wrapping style other than inline. This tab contains the following parameters that vary depending on the selected wrapping style: The Horizontal section allows you to select one of the following three chart positioning types: Alignment (left, center, right) relative to character, column, left margin, margin, page or right margin, Absolute Position measured in absolute units i.e. Centimeters/Points/Inches (depending on the option specified at the File -> Advanced Settings... tab) to the right of character, column, left margin, margin, page or right margin, Relative position measured in percent relative to the left margin, margin, page or right margin. The Vertical section allows you to select one of the following three chart positioning types: Alignment (top, center, bottom) relative to line, margin, bottom margin, paragraph, page or top margin, Absolute Position measured in absolute units i.e. Centimeters/Points/Inches (depending on the option specified at the File -> Advanced Settings... tab) below line, margin, bottom margin, paragraph, page or top margin, Relative position measured in percent relative to the margin, bottom margin, page or top margin. Move object with text controls whether the chart moves as the text to which it is anchored moves. Allow overlap controls whether two charts overlap or not if you drag them near each other on the page. The Alternative Text tab allows to specify a Title and Description which will be read to the people with vision or cognitive impairments to help them better understand what information there is in the chart."
