        <h1>Advanced Settings of Document Editor</h1>
        <p><b>Document Editor</b> lets you change its advanced settings. To access them, open the <b>File</b> tab at the top toolbar and select the <b>Advanced Settings...</b> option. You can also click the <b>View settings</b> <img alt="View settings icon" src="../images/viewsettingsicon.png" /> icon on the right side of the editor header and select the <b>Advanced settings</b> option.</p>
        <p>The advanced settings are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Commenting Display</b> is used to turn on/off the live commenting option:

                <li><b>Turn on display of the resolved comments</b> - this feature is disabled by default so that the resolved comments were hidden in the document text. You can view such comments only if you click the <b>Comments</b> <img alt="Comments icon" src="../images/commentsicon.png" /> icon at the left sidebar. Enable this option if you want to display resolved comments in the document text.</li>

            <li class="onlineDocumentFeatures"><b>Co-editing Mode</b> is used to select the display of the changes made during the co-editing:
                <ul>
                    <li>By default the <b>Fast</b> mode is selected, the users who take part in the document co-editing will see the changes in real time once they are made by other users.</li>
                    <li>If you prefer not to see other user changes (so that they do not disturb you, or for some other reason), select the <b>Strict</b> mode and all the changes will be shown only after you click the <b>Save</b> <img alt="Save icon" src="../images/saveupdate.png" /> icon notifying you that there are changes from other users.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="onlineDocumentFeatures">
                <b>Real-time Collaboration Changes</b> is used to specify what changes you want to be highlighted during co-editing:
                <ul>
                    <li>Selecting the <b>View None</b> option, changes made during the current session will not be highlighted.</li>
                    <li>Selecting the <b>View All</b> option, all the changes made during the current session will be highlighted.</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Default Zoom Value</b> is used to set the default zoom value selecting it in the list of available options from 50% to 200%. You can also choose the <b>Fit to Page</b> or <b>Fit to Width</b> option.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Font Hinting</b> is used to select the type a font is displayed in Document Editor:
                <ul>
                    <li>Choose <b>As Windows</b> if you like the way fonts are usually displayed on Windows, i.e. using Windows font hinting.</li>
                    <li>Choose <b>As OS X</b> if you like the way fonts are usually displayed on a Mac, i.e. without any font hinting at all.</li>
                    <li>Choose <b>Native</b> if you want your text to be displayed with the hinting embedded into font files.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Default cache mode</b> - used to select the cache mode for the font characters. It’s not recommended to switch it without any reason. It can be helpful in some cases only, for example, when an issue in the Google Chrome browser with the enabled hardware acceleration occurs.
            <p>Document Editor has two cache modes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>In the <b>first cache mode</b>, each letter is cached as a separate picture.</li>
                <li>In the <b>second cache mode</b>, a picture of a certain size is selected where letters are placed dynamically and a mechanism of allocating/removing memory in this picture is also implemented. If there is not enough memory, a second picture is created, etc.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The <b>Default cache mode</b> setting applies two above mentioned cache modes separately for different browsers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When the <b>Default cache mode</b> setting is enabled, Internet Explorer (v. 9, 10, 11) uses the <b>second cache mode</b>, other browsers use the <b>first cache mode</b>.</li>
                <li>When the <b>Default cache mode</b> setting is disabled, Internet Explorer (v. 9, 10, 11) uses the <b>first cache mode</b>, other browsers use the <b>second cache mode</b>.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Unit of Measurement</b> is used to specify what units are used on the rulers and in properties windows for measuring elements parameters such as width, height, spacing, margins etc. You can select the <b>Centimeter</b>, <b>Point</b>, or <b>Inch</b> option.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To save the changes you made, click the <b>Apply</b> button.</p>
