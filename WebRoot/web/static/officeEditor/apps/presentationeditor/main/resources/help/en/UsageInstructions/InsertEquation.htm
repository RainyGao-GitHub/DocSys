			<h1>Insert equations</h1>
            <p><b>Presentation Editor</b> allows you to build equations using the built-in templates, edit them, insert special characters (including mathematical operators, Greek letters, accents etc.).</p>
            <h3>Add a new equation</h3>
            <p>To insert an equation from the gallery,</p>
			<ol>
                <li>switch to the <b>Insert</b> tab of the top toolbar,</li>
				<li>click the arrow next to the <img alt="Equation icon" src="../images/insertequationicon.png" /> <b>Equation</b> icon at the top toolbar,</li>
				<li>in the opened drop-down list select the equation category you need. The following categories are currently available: <em>Symbols</em>, <em>Fractions</em>, <em>Scripts</em>, <em>Radicals</em>, <em>Integrals</em>, <em>Large Operators</em>, <em>Brackets</em>, <em>Functions</em>, <em>Accents</em>, <em>Limits and Logarithms</em>, <em>Operators</em>, <em>Matrices</em>,</li>
                <li>click the certain symbol/equation in the corresponding set of templates.</li>
			</ol>
            <p>The selected symbol/equation box will be inserted in the center of the current slide.</p>
            <img alt="Inserted Equation" src="../images/insertedequation.png" />
            <p>If you do not see the equation box border, click anywhere within the equation - the border will be displayed as a dashed line. The equation box can be freely <b>moved, resized or rotated</b> on the slide. To do that click on the equation box border (it will be displayed as a solid line) and use <a href="ManipulateObjects.htm" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">corresponding handles</a>.</p>
            <img alt="Selected Equation" src="../images/selectedequation.png" />
            <p>Each equation template represents a set of slots. Slot is a position for each element that makes up the equation. An empty slot (also called as a placeholder) has a dotted outline <img alt="Equation Placeholder" src="../images/equationplaceholder.png" />. You need to fill in all the placeholders specifying the necessary values.</p>
            <h3>Enter values</h3>
            <p>The <b>insertion point</b> specifies where the next character you enter will appear. To position the insertion point precisely, click within a placeholder and use the keyboard arrows to move the insertion point by one character left/right.</p>
            <img alt="Edited Equation" src="../images/newslot.png" />
            <p>Once the insertion point is positioned, you can fill in the placeholder:
            <ul>
                <li>enter the desired numeric/literal value using the keyboard,</li>
                <li>insert a special character using the <b>Symbols</b> palette from the <img alt="Equation icon" src="../images/insertequationicon.png" /> <b>Equation</b> menu at the <b>Insert</b> tab of the top toolbar,</li>
                <li>add another equation template from the palette to create a complex nested equation. The size of the primary equation will be automatically adjusted to fit its content. The size of the nested equation elements depends on the primary equation placeholder size, but it cannot be smaller than the sub-subscript size.</li>                
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><img alt="Edited Equation" src="../images/nestedfraction.png" /></p>
            <p>To add some new equation elements you can also use the <b>right-click menu options</b>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To add a new argument that goes before or after the existing one within <em>Brackets</em>, you can right-click on the existing argument and select the <b>Insert argument before/after</b> option from the menu.</li>
                <li>To add a new equation within <em>Cases</em> with several conditions from the <em>Brackets</em> group, you can right-click on an empty placeholder or entered equation within it and select the <b>Insert equation before/after</b> option from the menu.</li>
                <li>To add a new row or a column in a <em>Matrix</em>, you can right-click on a placeholder within it, select the <b>Insert</b> option from the menu, then select <b>Row Above/Below</b> or <b>Column Left/Right</b>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: currently, equations cannot be entered using the linear format, i.e. <b>\sqrt(4&x^3)</b>.</p>
            <p>When entering the values of the mathematical expressions, you do not need to use <b>Spacebar</b> as the spaces between the characters and signs of operations are set automatically.</p>
            <p>If the equation is too long and does not fit to a single line within the text box, automatic line breaking occurs as you type. You can also insert a line break in a specific position by right-clicking on a mathematical operator and selecting the <b>Insert manual break</b> option from the menu. The selected operator will start a new line. To delete the added manual line break, right-click on the mathematical operator that starts a new line and select the <b>Delete manual break</b> option.</p>
            <h3>Format equations</h3>
            <p>By default, the equation within the text box is horizontally centered and vertically aligned to the top of the text box. To change its horizontal/vertical alignment, put the cursor within the the equation box (the text box borders will be displayed as dashed lines) and use the <a href="../UsageInstructions/InsertText.htm#formattext" onclick="onhyperlinkclick(this)">corresponding icons</a> at the <b>Home</b> tab of the top toolbar.</p>
            <p>To increase or decrease the equation <b>font size</b>, click anywhere within the equation box and select the necessary font size from the list at the <b>Home</b> tab of the top toolbar. All the equation elements will change correspondingly.</p>
            <p>The letters within the equation are italicized by default. If necessary, you can change the <b>font style</b> (<em>bold, italic, strikeout</em>) or <b>color</b> for a whole equation or its part. The <em>underlined</em> style can be applied to the entire equation only, not to individual characters. Select the necessary part of the equation by clicking and dragging. The selected part will be highlighted blue. Then use the necessary buttons at the <b>Home</b> tab of the top toolbar to format the selection. For example, you can remove the italic format for ordinary words that are not variables or constants.</p>
            <img alt="Edited Equation" src="../images/formatastext.png" />
