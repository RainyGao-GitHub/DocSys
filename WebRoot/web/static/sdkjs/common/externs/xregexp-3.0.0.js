function XRegExp() {}

/**
 * Executes a regex search in a specified string. Returns a match array or `null`. If the provided
 * regex uses named capture, named backreference properties are included on the match array.
 * Optional `pos` and `sticky` arguments specify the search start position, and whether the match
 * must start at the specified position only. The `lastIndex` property of the provided regex is not
 * used, but is updated for compatibility. Also fixes browser bugs compared to the native
 * `RegExp.prototype.exec` and can be used reliably cross-browser.
 *
 * @memberOf XRegExp
 * @param {String} str String to search.
 * @param {RegExp} regex Regex to search with.
 * @param {Number} [pos=0] Zero-based index at which to start the search.
 * @param {Boolean|String} [sticky=false] Whether the match must start at the specified position
 *   only. The string `'sticky'` is accepted as an alternative to `true`.
 * @returns {Array} Match array with named backreference properties, or `null`.
 * @example
 *
 * // Basic use, with named backreference
 * let match = XRegExp.exec('U+2620', XRegExp('U\\+(?<hex>[0-9A-F]{4})'));
 * match.hex; // -> '2620'
 *
 * // With pos and sticky, in a loop
 * let pos = 2, result = [], match;
 * while (match = XRegExp.exec('<1><2><3><4>5<6>', /<(\d)>/, pos, 'sticky')) {
 *   result.push(match[1]);
 *   pos = match.index + match[0].length;
 * }
 * // result -> ['2', '3', '4']
 */
XRegExp.exec = function (str, regex, pos, sticky) {};

/**
 * Builds regexes using named subpatterns, for readability and pattern reuse. Backreferences in
 * the outer pattern and provided subpatterns are automatically renumbered to work correctly.
 * Native flags used by provided subpatterns are ignored in favor of the `flags` argument.
 *
 * @memberOf XRegExp
 * @param {String} pattern XRegExp pattern using `{{name}}` for embedded subpatterns. Allows
 *   `({{name}})` as shorthand for `(?<name>{{name}})`. Patterns cannot be embedded within
 *   character classes.
 * @param {Object} subs Lookup object for named subpatterns. Values can be strings or regexes. A
 *   leading `^` and trailing unescaped `$` are stripped from subpatterns, if both are present.
 * @param {String} [flags] Any combination of XRegExp flags.
 * @returns {RegExp} Regex with interpolated subpatterns.
 * @example
 *
 * const time = XRegExp.build('(?x)^ {{hours}} ({{minutes}}) $', {
     *   hours: XRegExp.build('{{h12}} : | {{h24}}', {
     *     h12: /1[0-2]|0?[1-9]/,
     *     h24: /2[0-3]|[01][0-9]/
     *   }, 'x'),
     *   minutes: /^[0-5][0-9]$/
     * });
 * time.test('10:59'); // -> true
 * XRegExp.exec('10:59', time).minutes; // -> '59'
